We versed ourselvesin 3-point estimations and contractually guaranteed results for our clients. Ourproject management skills were a focal point as we used our prior knowledgeof breaking down complex software problems into simpler tasks to hone howwe distributed work amongst a team of developers and designers.Development was full-stack, using FeathersJS and Node for RESTful andWebSocket-based APIs, with a service-oriented architecture, and Reactfor UIs. Additional tools were project specific, such as webpack, Next.js,and Tailwind CSS. A notable project was a Canvas-based web application,allowing for the identification of nodes needing to be addressed in a client-tailored lifecycle.BitoviSenior Software EngineerJune 2011 - June 2017 (6 years 1 month)Dallas, TXJoining a consulting agency allowed me to work with incredible people,solve interesting and unique problems, at a scale and pace unique to high-performing teams. I was part of a team hired, primarily by medium to largecorporations, with their own team of Senior Engineers, however, were inneed of expanding their skills in JavaScript, web-development, or getting theirproject across the finish line.The first couple of years were focused exclusively on web application, UIdevelopment. Architecture patterns, specifically tailored to the browser, wereour specialty. I contributed to tooling, developed by Bitovi, that had not yetexisted in the industry:* CanJS - a JavaScript, MV* frameworkPage 2 of 4* FuncUnit - a JavaScript testing framework which runs in browser, simulatinguser actionsA notable contribution to CanJS was the initial version of live-binding for EJS(embedded JavaScript) templates, demoed at JSConf 2012.Following the UI-specific development, we expanded into full-stackdevelopment with Node and training for clients, meetups, and conferences. Asone of the Senior Engineers, I led teams for multiple client projects and wasthe primary trainer for new client teams. Training was typically a 3-day to 2-week course of JavaScript, jQuery, and CanJS concepts. Notable exercisewas to develop a jQuery-lite version with trainees, allowing people to applyJavaScript and DOM fundamentals to real-world use cases.AutoRevoSenior Software DeveloperApril 2010 - June 2011 (1 year 3 months)Plano, Texas, United StatesAn opportunity not to be missed was re-joining the AutoRevo team with a newversion of the core systems, migrating from the original .NET infrastructure to aRuby on Rails system. The core MSSQL database remained, however, a newRails interface was developed utilizing jQuery and Backbone.Key contribution for this phase was the concept to develop a new mobile-focused interface for the consumer facing websites. A simple set of newRESTful APIs were developed in C# and consumed by a new jQuery MobileUI. This architecture choice reduced the project timeline from months to weeksof development.Landscape BrandsSoftware EngineerAugust 2007 - April 2010 (2 years 9 months)St Louis, Missouri, United StatesDeveloped a new version of the Landscape Brands, e-commerce webapplication. This was a .NET, C# application, with server-rendered pages,to allow for customers to place orders in concert with the more widely usedcall center services. Inventory was in sync between both initiatives, with datastored and accessed via MSSQL Server.AutoRevoPage 3 of 4Software DeveloperMay 2006 - August 2007 (1 year 4 months)Plano, Texas, United StatesDeveloped the first consumer-facing websites. These were developed usingthe .NET framework with C# as the core language. Primary contribution wasthe concept of dynamically generating WordPress websites, pulling data fromthe existing AutoRevo, RESTful APIs.Due to AutoRevo's core business and architecture, image storage was achallenge that resulted in multiple solutions in concert. This included round-robin targeting for where the image data was stored, dynamically resizingimages for consumption, and migrating images from system to system ascapacity was reached.CGS (Computer Generated Solutions)Support SpecialistSeptember 2004 - May 2005 (9 months)Dallas, Texas, United StatesProvided end-user support for Ernst & Young Inc. under contract with IBM.Acted as administrator for support teams in Lotus Notes and Windows andtrained new-hire technicians.EducationThe University of Texas at DallasBS, Computer Science Â· (2001 - 2007)Page 4 of 4
